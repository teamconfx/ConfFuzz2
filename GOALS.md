## Analyzing a configuration fuzzing campaign

Fuzz a analyze configuration fuzzing campaign using the analyze goal:

```
mvn confuzz:analyze
-Dconfuzz.generator=<G>
-Dmeringue.testClass=<C> 
-Dmeringue.testMethod=<M>
-DregexFile=<R>
[-DanalyzeOpt=<A>]
[-Dmeringue.duration=<D>]
[-Dmeringue.outputDirectory=<O>]
[-Dmeringue.javaOptions=<P>]
[-Dmeringue.maxTraceSize=<Z>]
[-Dmeringue.debug]
[-Dmeringue.timeout=<Y>]
[-Dmeringue.jacocoFormats=<F>]
```

Where:

* \<G\> is the fully-qualified name of the configuration generator class.
* \<C\> is the fully-qualified name of the test class.
* \<M\> is the name of the test method.
* \<R\> is the path of the configuration regex file.
* \<A\> is the optimization for the analysis, open this will turn off non-failure inputs analysis. The default value is true.
* \<D\> is the maximum amount of time to execute the fuzzing campaign for specified in the ISO-8601 duration format (
  e.g., 2 days, 3 hours, and 4 minutes is "P2DT3H4M"). The default value is one day.
* \<O\> is the path of the directory to which the output files should be written.
  The default value is ${project.build.directory}/meringue.
* \<P\> is a list of Java command line options that should be used for test JVMs.
* \<Z\> is the maximum number of frames to include in stack traces taken for failures. By default, a maximum of 5 frames
  are included.
* The presence of -Dmeringue.debug indicates that forked analysis JVMs should suspend and wait for a debugger to attach
  on port 5005. By default, forked analysis JVMs do not suspend and wait for a debugger to attach.
* \<Y\> is the maximum amount of time in seconds to execute a single input during analysis or -1 if no timeout should be
  used. By default, a timeout value of 600 seconds is used.
* \<F\> is a list of JaCoCo report formats to be generated. The formats XML, HTML, CSV are supported. By default, all
  formats are ignored.

## Analyzing a single failure input

Analyze a single failure input using the single-analyze goal:

```
mvn confuzz:single-analyze
-Dconfuzz.generator=<G>
-Dmeringue.testClass=<C> 
-Dmeringue.testMethod=<M>
-DregexFile=<R>
-DfailureId=<I>
[-Dmeringue.duration=<D>]
[-Dmeringue.outputDirectory=<O>]
[-Dmeringue.javaOptions=<P>]
[-Dmeringue.maxTraceSize=<Z>]
[-Dmeringue.debug]
[-Dmeringue.timeout=<Y>]
[-Dmeringue.jacocoFormats=<F>]
```

Where:

* \<G\> is the fully-qualified name of the configuration generator class.
* \<C\> is the fully-qualified name of the test class.
* \<M\> is the name of the test method.
* \<R\> is the path of the configuration regex file.
* \<I\> is the ID of the failure input to analyze.
* \<D\> is the maximum amount of time to execute the fuzzing campaign for specified in the ISO-8601 duration format (
  e.g., 2 days, 3 hours, and 4 minutes is "P2DT3H4M"). The default value is one day.
* \<O\> is the path of the directory to which the output files should be written.
  The default value is ${project.build.directory}/meringue.
* \<P\> is a list of Java command line options that should be used for test JVMs.
* \<Z\> is the maximum number of frames to include in stack traces taken for failures. By default, a maximum of 5 frames
  are included.
* The presence of -Dmeringue.debug indicates that forked analysis JVMs should suspend and wait for a debugger to attach
  on port 5005. By default, forked analysis JVMs do not suspend and wait for a debugger to attach.
* \<Y\> is the maximum amount of time in seconds to execute a single input during analysis or -1 if no timeout should be
  used. By default, a timeout value of 600 seconds is used.
* \<F\> is a list of JaCoCo report formats to be generated. The formats XML, HTML, CSV are supported. By default, all
  formats are ignored.



## Debugging the root-cause parameter set of a single failure
Debug a configuration using the debug goal.
This goal produces failures.csv file under ${meringue.outputDirectory}/single-analyze-results.

This goal requires the output from "confuzz:single-analyze" goal. Please execute "confuzz:single-analyze" before running this.



```
mvn confuzz:single-debug
-Dmeringue.testClass=<C> 
-Dmeringue.testMethod=<M>
-DregexFile=<R>
-DfailureId=<I>
[-Dmeringue.outputDirectory=<O>]
```

Where:

* \<C\> is the fully-qualified name of the test class.
* \<M\> is the name of the test method.
* \<R\> is the path of the configuration regex file.
* \<I\> is the ID of the failure input to analyze.
* \<O\> is the path of the directory to which the output files should be written.
  The default value is ${project.build.directory}/meringue.

## Debugging the root-cause parameter set from a JSON configuration file generated by `confuzz:fuzz`
This will generate an `buggyConfigFile.json` file under current directory.

```
mvn confuzz:debug-file
-Dmeringue.testClass=<C> 
-Dmeringue.testMethod=<M>
-DsourceConfigFile=<I>
[-Ddebug=<D>]
[-DdebugOutput=<O>]
```

Where:

* \<C\> is the fully-qualified name of the test class.
* \<M\> is the name of the test method.
* \<I\> is the JSON configuration file generated by `confuzz:fuzz` in `failures` directory.
* \<D\> is the boolean. Control whether run debug to generate `buggyConfigFile.json` or not. The default value is true.
* \<O\> is the boolean. Control whether run single parameter from `buggyConfigFile.json` or not. The default value is false.
